# **App Name**: Neon Serpent

## Core Features:

- Snake Movement: Control a snake to move around the game board using keyboard or touch inputs.
- Food Consumption: The snake eats food to grow longer; special foods may have other effects. A tool decides where new food appears on the board, favoring locations which are challenging to reach and that prevent the snake from creating closed loops.
- Obstacle Avoidance: Avoid obstacles such as walls, moving blocks, and the snake's own body.
- Power-ups: Collect power-ups like speed boosts, temporary invincibility, and shrinking.
- Level Progression: Progress through levels with increasing difficulty, new obstacles, and unique layouts. Use portals to move the snake from one area of the board to another.
- Scoring System: Calculate score based on food eaten and level completion. Implement combo scoring for eating multiple foods quickly.
- Settings: Implement settings like custom snake skins and adjustable game speed.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric purple (#BE29EC) to give a cyberpunk, energetic feel.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated purple (#17111A), provides a dark background for contrast.
- Accent color: Bright yellow (#E2D92F), analogous to purple, for highlights and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font for a computerized, techy feel.
- Use glowing, neon-style icons for power-ups and menu options.
- Modern, full-screen layout with a focus on clarity and readability. Animated transitions between levels and menus.
- Smooth animations for snake movement, food consumption, and power-up effects. Implement particle effects for glowing elements.
